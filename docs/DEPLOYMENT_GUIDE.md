# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## Build Fixed! ✅

The build errors have been resolved by:
- ✅ Removed problematic `imagemin` optimization that was causing failures
- ✅ Simplified build process to standard React build
- ✅ Added `serve` dependency for local testing
- ✅ Created Windows PowerShell deployment script

## 🏗️ Build & Deploy

### **1. Build for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```

### **2. Test Locally** 
```bash
npm run serve
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

### **3. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (one time)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### **4. Alternative: Use PowerShell Script**
```powershell
# Windows users can use the automated script
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### **Vercel (Recommended) - Zero Config**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Auto-deploys on every push to main
3. Custom domain support
4. Built-in analytics

### **Netlify**
1. Drag & drop `build` folder to Netlify
